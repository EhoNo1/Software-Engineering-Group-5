# Software Engineering Group 5: First-Person RPG Framework

## Project Setup Instructions
To ensure you can run and work on the project you'll need to install the correct version of Unity. Download and Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub), it will handle installation for you. (You will need a free Unity account in order to use Unity Hub.)

If you haven't done so already, clone this repo to your device. Next, Open unity hub, and once at the project list click the `Add` dropdown and select `Add project from disk`.

**Note:** If at any point you are required to select a license, select a Personal license. Its free for students and Independent developers making under 100K a year. 

Once the project is in the list, if you don't have the correct version installed there will be a "Warning" symbol on the project listing. Click that and it should prompt and guide you into installing the correct version.

Installing Visual Studio is reccommended but not required. You can use a separate Visual Studio or VS Code installation, just be sure to also install each editor's respective Unity plugin. You'll only need to install the build modules for your OS you're working on (usually it's required). You're welcome to install any others if you'd like.

Once the correct version and it's modules finish installing, the warning symbol should disapear, and you should be able to click on the list entry and startup the editor with no issues. Unity will automatically resolve and download any extra project packages as needed on startup.

**Please make sure you are able to at least open the empty project without issue before we start the first sprint.**
